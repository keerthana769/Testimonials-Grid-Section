        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&rsquo;s worth.</h2>
        <p class="content__description description1"> &ldquo; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve been looking to make a 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I&rsquo;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2 class="content__title title5">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p class="content__description description5">&ldquo; Before joining the bootcamp, I&rsquo;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I&rsquo;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! &rdquo;</p>
